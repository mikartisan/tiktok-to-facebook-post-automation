# TikTok ‚Üí Facebook Auto Uploader

This project automates downloading the latest TikTok video from a given account and re-uploading it to a Facebook Page using the **Facebook Graph API**.  
It runs daily via **GitHub Actions** and ensures no duplicate posts are uploaded.

## ü§ñ GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow is defined in .github/workflows/tiktok-to-fb.yml.

It:

1.  Runs every day at **6PM UTC** (configurable via cron).
2.  Restores the last uploaded TikTok video ID (last_video_id.txt).
3.  Runs the Python script:

    -   Skips if no new TikTok video.
    -   Downloads & uploads if a new one is found.

4.  Saves the updated last_video_id.txt as an artifact for the next run.

### Run manually

You can also trigger it manually from the **Actions** tab.

## üìù Notes

-   last_video_id.txt is stored as a **GitHub Action artifact**, not in your repo.
-   Artifacts are visible in each workflow run summary and expire after **90 days** by default.
-   If you want permanent tracking inside your repo, you could commit the file instead of using artifacts.
